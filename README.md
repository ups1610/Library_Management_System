**Library Service:** Manages library operations such as book shelving and location tracking.

**Infrastructure:**

Includes a registry server for service discovery and registration.
Implements load balancer setup for scalability and reliability.

**Features:**
Role-based access control for users (cataloger, librarian, admin, accountant).
Book management features including adding authors, genres, and book instances.
Membership management with various membership plans.
Book borrowing and returning functionality with automatic fine calculation.
User management allowing new user registration, editing, and role assignment.
Responsive UI design for accessibility across devices.
